# Day-2-
This is the day 2 of the 30 days of Data Analyst Internship at Elevate Labs

On Day 2 we were given the task of making a dashboard or creating data visuals for any sales dataset using a data visualization tool like Power BI or Tableau.

I have used MS Power BI as I already had some working experience with Power BI.

I have used Pie chart, Stacked Column chart, Clustered Column chart, and a Card visuals to make this dashboard and I also have shared the screenshot of it.
